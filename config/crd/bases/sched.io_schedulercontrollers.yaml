                                MultiPoint is a simplified config section to enable plugins for all valid extension points.
                                Plugins enabled through MultiPoint will automatically register for every individual extension
                                point the plugin has implemented. Disabling a plugin through MultiPoint disables that behavior.
                                The same is true for disabling "*" through MultiPoint (no default plugins will be automatically registered).
                                Plugins can still be disabled through their individual extension points.

                                In terms of precedence, plugin config follows this basic hierarchy
                                  1. Specific extension points
                                  2. Explicitly configured MultiPoint plugins
                                  3. The set of default plugins, as MultiPoint plugins
                                This implies that a higher precedence plugin will run first and overwrite any settings within MultiPoint.
                                Explicitly user-configured plugins also take a higher precedence over default plugins.
                                Within this hierarchy, an Enabled setting takes precedence over Disabled. For example, if a plugin is
                                set in both `multiPoint.Enabled` and `multiPoint.Disabled`, the plugin will be enabled. Similarly,
                                including `multiPoint.Disabled = '*'` and `multiPoint.Enabled = pluginA` will still register that specific
                                plugin through MultiPoint. This follows the same behavior as all other extension point configurations.
